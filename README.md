# Blocktree Landing Page

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Description
A landing page for Blocktree, a revolutionary blockchain scaling solution powering interstellar DApps and space economies, built with Remix. Inspired by discussions on X with @billqian_uae and @IbaiBasabe, Blocktree uses a hierarchical "blocktree" structure to scale blockchains for AI-driven economies, edge decentralized applications (DApps), and interstellar finance.

## Use Cases
- AI Economies: Enable AI agents to trade and invest in DeFi using edge DApps on the Blocktree network.
- Interstellar Finance: Power financial systems for space exploration and trade between planets.
- Massive DeFi Scaling: Support global decentralized finance with near-infinite capacity.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
